# Element Words

This project is basically just a recursive algorithm for finding out if you can spell a word using symbols from the periodic table.

### Usage
If you pass in arguments when executing this from the command line it will search for spellings for the provided words. If you don't provide any arguments it will simply search the majority of the words in the english language and provide some mildly interesting stats about them.

### Plans
I'm planning on making this a library, because why not?
